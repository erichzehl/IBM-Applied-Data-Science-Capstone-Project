## IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

This project is the Capstone Project of IBM's Applied Data Science Certificate offered on Coursera. This project aims to explore the largest islands of the Canary Islands (El Hierro, Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, La Gomera, Lanzarote and La Palma) as potential places for retirement. Its objective is to determine in a first stage, which of the islands would be the best candidate for retirement, and in a second stage, which properties would be appropriate based on a given set of preferences.

To solve the first part of the problem, the project analyzes weather data. Once one of the islands is selected for retirement based on the best weather, it then analyzes and compares the availability of amenities and essential services, and the characteristics of currently available real estate properties in order to offer a recommendation for the best-suited properties on that particular island.
