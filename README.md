# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

### This project is the Capstone Project of IBM's Applied Data Science Certificate offered on Coursera. This project aims to explore the five largest islands of the Canary Islands (Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and La Palma) as potential places for retirement. Its objective is to determine in a first stage, which of the islands would be the best candidate for retirement, and in a second stage, which city/town/neighborhood would be the most appropriate for buying a property for retirement based on a given set of preferences.
